**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Shining Sentinels are proficient in all simple and martial weapons, and all armor and shields (including tower shields). If a Shining Sentinel worships a good deity with an exotic favored weapon, that weapon is treated as a martial weapon.

**Protector (Ex)**: At 1st level, a Shining Sentinel receives the Bodyguard feat, whether or not she meets the prerequisites. She gains a number of additional attacks of opportunity per round equal to her shield bonus to AC (including Shield Focus and Greater Shield Focus, and any other feat or feature that increases a shield's bonus to AC, but not its enhancement bonus), and when she uses Bodyguard, the AC bonus she provides increases by +1. This increases by an additional +1 at 5th and 9th levels.

**Knight's Training (Ex)**: For the purposes of qualifying for feats, Shining Sentinel levels count as fighter levels.

**Armor Training (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a Shining Sentinel gains armor training (as the fighter class feature). If they have no levels in fighter or another class that grants armor training, their effective fighter level for armor training is their class level + 1. Otherwise, their Shining Sentinel levels stack with levels in any class granting armor training.

**Bonus Feats**: At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Shining Sentinel gains a bonus feat from the following list: Armor Focus, Bashing Finish, Greater Shield Focus, Greater Shield Specialization, Improved Armor Focus, Improved Shield Bash, Improved Shield Focus, Missile Shield, Mobile Bulwark Style, Mobile Fortress, Mobile Stronghold, Mounted Shield, Ray Shield, Shield Master, Shield Slam, Shield Specialization, or any armor mastery or shield mastery feat.

**Improved Protector (Ex)**: At 4th level, a Shining Sentinel receives the In Harm's Way feat, whether or not she meets the prerequisites. When she uses In Harm's Way to take damage instead of an ally, she can reduce the damage by half the sum of her armor and shield bonus to AC (including any feats or features that increase an armor or shield's bonus to AC, as well as enhancement bonuses).

**Divine Healing (Sp)**: At 4th level, a Shining Sentinel can cast *cure light wounds* as a spell-like ability (using her class level as her caster level) a number of times per day equal to her class level. At 7th level, this improves to *cure moderate wounds*, and at 10th level, it improves to *cure serious wounds*. Alternatively, she can expend a use of this ability to treat deadly wounds on a creature as a full-round action, gaining a bonus to the Heal check equal to her class level, and on a success, healing the target a number of extra Hit Points equal to twice her class level plus her Wisdom modifier. Treating deadly wounds in this way does not require a healer's kit.

**Advanced Armor Training (Ex)**: At 5th level, and again at 8th level, a Shining Sentinel gains an advanced armor training option from those available to fighters.

**Aura of Courage (Su)**: At 10th level, a Shining Sentinel gains the aura of courage feature (as the paladin feature). If she already has an aura of courage, she gains the Fearless Aura feat.
