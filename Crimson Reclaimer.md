**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Crimson Reclaimers are proficient in all simple and martial weapons, and light armor, medium armor, and shields (but not tower shields). If a Crimson Reclaimer worships a good deity with an exotic favored weapon, that weapon is treated as a martial weapon.

**Favored Enemy (Ex)**: At 1st level, a Crimson Reclaimer gains a favored enemy bonus of +1 against undead, or if the Crimson Reclaimer already has favored enemy (undead) from another class, increases her existing bonus by +1. (This doesn’t increase existing favored enemy bonuses against any other creature types.) This otherwise functions as the ranger class ability. At 4th, 7th, and 10th levels, this bonus increases by 1.

**Survivor of Desolation (Ex)**: A Crimson Reclaimer gains a bonus to saving throws equal to half her level (minimum 1) against unnatural weather events or environmental hazards occurring in blighted regions.

**Lay On Hands (Su)**: At 2nd level, a Crimson Reclaimer gains the ability to heal wounds by touch. This functions as the paladin class feature of the same name, treating the Crimson Reclaimer's class level as her effective paladin level. These levels stack with any other in any class granting lay on hands.

**Spells Per Day**: At 2nd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, a character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in any one divine spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class before she became a Crimson Reclaimer, she must decide to which class she adds each qualifying level of Crimson Reclaimer for the purpose of determining spells per day.

**Combat Style Feat (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a Crimson Reclaimer selects a combat style available to rangers. She gains a combat style feat at 3rd, 7th, and 10th levels (using her Crimson Reclaimer level as her effective ranger level). If the Crimson Reclaimer has levels in ranger (or another class granting a combat style), she must pick the same combat style, and the levels stack for the purpose of determining the list of feats she can pick from.

**Undead Hunter (Ex)**: Starting at 3rd level, a Crimson Reclaimer adds 1/3 her class level to Bluff, Disguise, Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense Motive, Stealth, and Survival checks made about or against undead.

**Mercy (Su)**: At 4th and 8th level, a Crimson Reclaimer can select one mercy, using her class level as her effective paladin level (stacking with levels in any class granting mercy).

**Blade of the Crimson Oath (Su)**: At 5th level, a Crimson Reclaimer can, as a swift action, call upon the Crimson Oath. For 1 round, she gains a sacred bonus to attack rolls and AC equal to her Charisma modifier against an undead target she can see, and a sacred bonus to weapon damage rolls equal to her character level against that target. The Crimson Reclaimer can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her class level plus her Charisma modifier.

**Focused Training (Ex)**: At 5th and 9th level, a Crimson Reclaimer gains Skill Focus in any Crimson Reclaimer class skill.

**Undead Slayer (Su)**: At 10th level, a Crimson Reclaimer can instantly destroy unaware undead with a single attack. When attacking an undead that isn't aware of her presence, she doubles her favored enemy bonus to attack and damage rolls, and the target must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + the Crimson Reclaimer's class level + her Charisma modifier) or be instantly destroyed. If the attack is a critical hit, the target takes a -4 penalty to this saving throw. The Crimson Reclaimer can attempt this a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.
